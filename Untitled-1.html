<html>
    <!__ head is used to store data what ever we dont see like css and java script files so no one see them __>
    <head></head>

    <BODY>
        <H1>this is my first tag !!!!</H1>
        <!__ the biggest heading on the page __> 
        <p>here this is called paragraph tag it is used to write paragraphs so that thethe text could be represented 
            as a paragraph and spacing is automatically managed</p>>      
        <h2>size drease with time</h2>
        <h6>and see the difference</h6>

        <button> click me </button>
        <!__ button is used to put a button and the text in between is the text on button __>
        <H3>lists and it hast 2 types ordered list and unordered</H3>
        <h4><strong>best tag for the bold text is strong hence</strong></h4>

        <p>the difference between them is the ordered contains numbered list and the other one contains the bullets and points 
            so unordered list<p>
            <P>the tag for ordered list is ol  but is empty as it defines just that the thing is ordered but what is ordered 
                so to show something we have to feed it with list tag which is li </P>
            <ol>
                <li>red</li>
                <li>blue</li>

                    <li>white</li>
    
                </ul>
                <p>ul is for unordered list</p>
                <p>you can put another list inside a list</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>red</li>
                        <li>blue</li>
